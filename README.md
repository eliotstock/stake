# How to build an Ethereum staking machine

These instructions are up to date wrt the following releases.

* `nethermind` 1.18.2
* `lighthouse` 4.2.0
* `mev-boost` 1.5.0

## Initial host setup

1. (Optional) Update the firmware in your router, factory reset, reconfigure.
1. Grab an Intel NUC. Mine is a i5-1135G7, 4 cores.
1. Set the machine to restart after a power failure.
    1. `F2` during boot to get into BIOS settings
    1. Power > Secondary power settings
    1. After power failure: Power on
    1. `F10` to save and exit
1. (Optional) If re-installing, back up the following from the existing host.
    1. `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
1. Install Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS amd64
    1. F10 on boot to boot from USB for Intel NUC
    1. Minimal server installation
    1. Check ethernet interface(s) have a connection, use DHCP for now
    1. Use an entire disk, 250GB SSD, LVM group, no need to encrypt
    1. Take photo of file system summary screen during installation
    1. Hostname: stake, username: [redacted]
    1. Import SSH identity: yes, GitHub, donâ€™t allow password auth over SSH
    1. Use the [redacted] SSH public key from GitHub
    1. No extra snaps
1. Remember `Ctrl-Alt F1` through `F6` are there for switching to new terminals and multitasking.
1. Partition and mount the big drive
    1. `lsblck` and confirm the big drive isn't mounted yet and is called `sda`
    1. `sudo parted --list` and confirm it's not partitioned yet
    1. `sudo fdisk /dev/sda`, `n` for new partition, `p` for primary, `1`, default first sector, default last sector, `w` to write.
    1. `sudo parted /dev/sda`, `mklabel gpt`, `unit TB`, `mkpart`, `primary`, `ext4`, `0`, `2`, `print` and check output, `quit`.
    1. Format the partition: `sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sda`
    1. Get the UUID for the drive from `sudo blkid`
    1. Add something like this to the bottom of `/etc/fstab`: `/dev/disk/by-uuid/8723beb1-8bb4-4a34-8c01-c309361eedc5 /data ext4 defaults 0 2`
    1. `sudo mount -a` and confirm the drive is mounted with `ls -lah /data`
    1. Make the drive writable by your user with `sudo chown -R [USERNAME]:[USERNAME] /data`
    1. `df -H` and confirm the drive is there and mostly free space
    1. Reboot and make sure the drive mounts again
1. Test the performance of the big drive
    1. `sudo apt install fio`
    1. `fio --randrepeat=1 --ioengine=libaio --direct=1 --gtod_reduce=1 --name=test --filename=random_read_write.fio --bs=4k --iodepth=64 --size=4G --readwrite=randrw --rwmixread=75`
    1. Output is explained [here](https://tobert.github.io/post/2014-04-17-fio-output-explained.html)
    1. If you can't remember what drive you bought, `sudo hdparm -I /dev/sda` (where `sda` may be something else) will give you the details.
1. Disable `cloud-init`
    1. `sudo touch /etc/cloud/cloud-init.disabled`
    1. `sudo reboot`
    1. Make sure you can still log in as your new user.
    1. `sudo dpkg-reconfigure cloud-init` and uncheck everything except `None`.
    1. `sudo apt-get purge cloud-init`
    1. `sudo rm -rf /etc/cloud/ && sudo rm -rf /var/lib/cloud/`
    1. `sudo reboot`
    1. Again, make sure you can still log in as your new user.
1. Configure a static IP address.
    1. Get the interface name from `ip link`. This might be `epn88s0`.
    1. Paste the below block into a new `netplan` config file: `sudo nano /etc/netplan/01-config.yaml`.
        1. A subnet mask of `/24` means only the last octet (8 bits) in the address changes for each device on the subnet.
        1. The DNS servers here are Google's and Cloudflare's.
        1. You might also consider using 9.9.9.9 (Quad9, does filtering of known malware sites).
        1. `.yaml` files use spaces for indentation (either 2 or 4), not tabs.
    1. `sudo netplan apply`
```
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    eth0:
      dhcp4: no
      addresses:
        - 192.168.20.41/24
      gateway4: 192.168.20.1
      nameservers:
        addresses: [8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1]
```
1. Change the ssh port from the default
    1. `sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config`
    1. Uncomment the `Port` line. Pick a memorable port number/make a note of it.
    1. Restart `sshd`: `sudo service sshd restart`
    1. Make sure there's an `.ssh` directory in your home directory for later: `mkdir -p ~/.ssh`
    1. When connecting from a client, use the `-p [port]` arg for `ssh`
1. Configure the firewall
    1. Confirm `ufw` is installed: `which ufw`
    1. `sudo ufw default deny incoming`
    1. `sudo ufw default allow outgoing`
    1. `sudo ufw allow [your ssh port]/tcp comment 'ssh'`
    1. `sudo ufw allow 30303 comment 'execution client'`
    1. `sudo ufw allow 9000 comment 'consensus client'`
    1. `sudo ufw allow 8545/tcp comment 'execution client health'`
    1. `sudo ufw allow 8551/tcp comment 'execution client health'`
    1. `sudo ufw enable`
    1. Note that `http` and `https` are absent above.
    1. Check which ports are accessible with `sudo ufw status`
    1. Also block pings: `sudo nano /etc/ufw/before.rules`, find the line reading `A ufw-before-input -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j ACCEPT` and change `ACCEPT` to `DROP`
    1. `sudo ufw reload`
1. If you chose the wrong hostname during the installer, change it now. `sudo nano /etc/hostname` and pick a cool hostname.
1. Update packages and get some stuff
    1. `sudo apt update`
    1. `sudo apt upgrade` (make coffee)
    1. `sudo apt install net-tools emacs git`
1. Make sure that `unattended-updates` works for more than just security updates and includes non-Ubuntu PPAs.
    1. `sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades`
    1. Change the origins section to this:
```
Unattended-Upgrade::Origins-Pattern {
      "o=*";
}
```
1. (Optional and only required if you didn't restore SSH keys from GitHub during installation) Set up ssh keys for all client machines from which you'll want to connect.
    1. If re-installing, restore the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file you backed up earlier, using `scp`.
        1. Try connecting using `ssh` first
        1. You'll get an error about the host key changing, including a command to run to forget the old host key. Run it.
        1. Now do the `scp` copy: `scp -P 1035 ./authorized_keys [username]@[ip]:/home/[username]/.ssh/authorized_keys`
    1. Otherwise:
        1. You might like to set an alias in `~/.bashrc` such as `alias <random-name>="ssh -p [port] [username]@[server IP]"`
        1. Similarly for scp: `alias <random-name>="scp -P [port] $1 [username]@[server IP]:/home/[username]"`
        1. `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "[client nickname]"`
        1. No passphrase.
        1. Accept the default path. You'll get both `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` (public key) and `~/.ssh/id_rsa` (private key).
        1. Copy the public key to the server: `scp -P [port] ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub [username]@[server IP]:/home/[username]/.ssh/authorized_keys`
        1. Verify the file is there on the server.
        1. Verify you can ssh in to the server and you're not prompted for a password. Use the alias you created earlier.
1. Only allow ssh'ing in using a key from now on. `sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config` and set `PasswordAuthentication no`.
    1. `sudo service sshd restart`
    1. Check you can `ssh` in from the client without entering a password.
1. Ban any IP address that has multiple failed login attempts using `fail2ban`
    1. `sudo apt install fail2ban`
    1. `sudo cp /etc/fail2ban/fail2ban.conf /etc/fail2ban/fail2ban.local`
    1. `sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/fail2ban.local` and add:
        1. `[sshd]`
        1. `enabled = true`
        1. `port = [port]`
        1. `filter = sshd`
        1. `logpath = /var/log/auth.log`
        1. `maxretry = 3`
        1. `bantime = -1`
    1. `sudo service fail2ban restart`
    1. Check for any banned IPs later with `sudo fail2ban-client status sshd`
1. (Optional) Configure git user. Cache the personal access token from Github for one week.
    1. `git config --global user.email "foo@example.com"`
    1. `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`
    1. `git config --global credential.helper cache`
    1. `git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=604800'`
    1. Assuming your Github user auth is configured like mine, copy your personal access token to the clipboard and `ssh` into the host
    1. Pull any repos you might need: `git clone [repo's https url] [repo dir]`
    1. From inside each repo working directory: `git config pull.rebase false`
1. Forward ports from the router to the host:
    1. Any execution client: 30303 (both TCP and UDP)
    1. Lighthouse (consensus client): 9000 (both TCP and UDP)
    1. Only while travelling, SSH: [redacted] TCP

## Clients

### Nethermind (execution layer client)

1. Follow instructions here: https://docs.nethermind.io/nethermind/first-steps-with-nethermind/getting-started. Use the Ubuntu repo.
1. Create a directory for the Rocks DB: `mkdir /data/nethermind`
1. Run the client as your normal user `nethermind --config mainnet --baseDbPath /data/nethermind --JsonRpc.Enabled true`
1. Follow instructions for `systemd` running here: https://docs.nethermind.io/nethermind/first-steps-with-nethermind/manage-nethermind-with-systemd, except:
    1. Create the `nethermind` user with a specific home dir: `sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -d /data/nethermind nethermind`
    1. Note that `adduser` accepts ` --disabled-password` but the lower level `useradd` does not.
1. Add the `nethermind` user to sudoers: `sudo usermod -aG sudo nethermind`
1. TODO: Maybe not: Set a password for the `nethermind` user
    1. `sudo -i`
    1. `passwd nethermind`
1. Change to the `nethermind` user: `sudo su nethermind`
1. Run the serivce: `sudo service nethermind start`
1. Check the output: `journalctl -u nethermind -f`
1. Enable autorun: `sudo systemctl enable nethermind`
1. TODO: Blocked on docs bug: https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/issues/4482
1. Disable the `systemd` unit while it isn't working on boot: `sudo systemctl disable nethermind`

### Lighthouse (consensus layer client)

1. Go to https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/releases and find the latest (non-portable) release, with suffix `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`. Download, extract and delete  it on the host.
    1. `wget https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/releases/download/v4.0.1/lighthouse-v4.0.1-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz`
    1. `tar -xvf lighthouse-*.tar.gz`
    1. `rm lighthouse-*.tar.gz`
1. Make sure it runs: `./lighthouse --version`
1. Move the binary out of your home dir:
    1. `sudo mv ./lighthouse /usr/bin`
    1. `sudo chown root:root /usr/bin/lighthouse`

### MEV-Boost

1. Download the latest binary from https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/releases
1. Extract and delete the tarball: `tar -xvf mev* && rm mev*.tar.gz`
1. Move the binary: `mv mev-boost /data`
1. If you have no strong opinions about what kind of relay to use, just use Ultra Sound:
    * `https://0xa1559ace749633b997cb3fdacffb890aeebdb0f5a3b6aaa7eeeaf1a38af0a8fe88b9e4b1f61f236d2e64d95733327a62@relay.ultrasound.money`
1. If you do, however, pick one or more from the [eth-educators list](https://github.com/eth-educators/ethstaker-guides/blob/main/MEV-relay-list.md). You also might like to check https://www.relayscan.io/.

### One-time client setup

1. Generate a JWT token to be used by the clients:
    1. `openssl rand -hex 32 | tr -d "\n" > "/data/jwtsecret"`
1. The first time you sync only, or if you've fallen far behind, use a checkpoint sync endpoint for the beacon node:
    1. `lighthouse --network mainnet --datadir /data/lighthouse/mainnet bn --execution-endpoint http://localhost:8551 --execution-jwt /data/jwtsecret --checkpoint-sync-url https://beaconstate.ethstaker.cc`
        1. Get the checkpoint sync URL from https://eth-clients.github.io/checkpoint-sync-endpoints/
        1. See this thread in the Lighthouse Discord for more details o checks: https://discord.com/channels/605577013327167508/605577013331361793/1019755522985050142
1. Do the key management stuff for Lighthouse: https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/key-management.html
    1. Create a password file for this network: `nano stake.pass` and `chmod 600 ./stake.pass`
    1. `lighthouse --network mainnet account wallet create --name stake --password-file stake.pass`
    1. Write down mnemonic -> sock drawer (not really obvs)
    1. `lighthouse --network mainnet account validator create --wallet-name stake --wallet-password stake.pass --count 1`

## Staking

1. Get yourself a new address to use as the fee recipient address. Should be on a hardware wallet, seed phrase secure etc. Don't worry about the withdrawal address at this point.
1. On the staking machine:
    1. Download, extract and tidy up the staking deposit CLI.
        1. `cd /data`
        1. `wget https://github.com/ethereum/staking-deposit-cli/releases/download/v2.3.0/staking_deposit-cli-76ed782-linux-amd64.tar.gz`
        1. `tar -xvf staking_deposit-cli-76ed782-linux-amd64.tar.gz`
        1. `rm staking_deposit-cli-76ed782-linux-amd64.tar.gz`
        1. `mv staking_deposit-cli-76ed782-linux-amd64/deposit .`
        1. `rmdir staking_deposit-cli-76ed782-linux-amd64`
    1. Go offline before generating the mnemonic. In a perfect world you do this on an air-gapped machine with a fresh OS installation that's never been online. But having the validator keys on the staking machine itself at the end is convenient, so simply doing it on the staking machine while offline is acceptable, imo. Reboot before and after generating the mnemonic.
    1. Run it and record the mnemonic. We'll generate two keys but use only one for now.
        1. `./deposit new-mnemonic --num_validators 2 --chain mainnet`
        1. The _password that secures your validator keystore(s)_ doesn't need to be super secure. Someone with these keys can sabotage your validator performance but can't withdraw your stake.
    1. This will generate:
        1. `./validator_keys/deposit_data-*.json`
        1. `./validator_keys/keystore-m_12381_3600_0_0_0-1663727039.json`
    1. Remember this mnemonic can be used to regenerate both the signing key and the withdrawal key for later after Shanghai, although you'll get a slightly different keystore file if you do, even if you use the same password.
    1. Import only the first of the two keystores into the validator:
        1. `lighthouse --network mainnet --datadir /data/lighthouse/mainnet account validator import --keystore /data/validator_keys/keystore-m_12381_3600_0_0_0-*.json` and enter the password for the keystore.
    1. Back the keystore up onto a USB drive
        1. First format the drive:
            1. `lsblk`, plug the drive in, 'lsblk' again to spot the name of the device. Might be `/dev/sda`.
            1. Unmount any paritions if they're mounted: `sudo umount /dev/sda1`, `sudo umount /dev/sda2`.
            1. Make a new partition table: `sudo fdisk /dev/sda`, `o`, `n`, `p`, `1`, default, default, `w`
            1. Format the new partition: `sudo mkfs.vfat -F 32 -n 'keys' /dev/sda1`
            1. Eject: `sudo eject /dev/sda`
            1. Reinsert the drive
            1. `sudo mkdir /media/usb`
            1. `sudo mount -t vfat /dev/sdb1 /media/usb`
        1. `sudo cp -r /data/validator_keys /media/usb`
        1. `sudo eject /media/usb`
1. On the machine where you have MetaMask and your hardware wallet connected:
    1. Run through the checklist at https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/checklist and make sure everything tickety-boo.
    1. Get to https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/upload-deposit-data where you upload your deposit data.
    1. Plug in the USB drive and mount it.
    1. Get as far as https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/generate-keys in the Launchpad flow. This is where you upload your deposit data JSON file, connect using the account you have on your hardware wallet, and pay the 32 ETH.
    1. If you generated more keys than you needed:
        1. Edit the deposit data JSON file down to just the ones you're funding, and
        1. Edit the `/data/lighthouse/mainnet/validators/validator_definitions.yml` file to disable the other validators.
    1. This transaction cost 50,634 gas, which was 0.00065 ETH at the time when I last did it. Having 0.001 ETH in your accouint to cover gas should be more than enough.
1. Copy the public keys of the validator(s) you're funding from `/data/lighthouse/mainnet/validators/validator_definitions.yml` so you can paste them into beaconcha.in later (see Monitoring below)

## On server restart

Each time the server starts, run the below four processes inside `tmux`.

1. Run `tmux` first. Refresher:
    1. Create five panes with `C-b "`
    1. Make them evenly sized with `C-b :` (to enter the command prompt) then `select-layout even-vertical`
    1. Move around the panes with `C-b [arrow keys]`
    1. Kill a pane with `C-b C-d`
    1. Dettach from the session with `C-b d`

### Execution client

```
nethermind --datadir /data/nethermind --config /usr/share/nethermind/configs/mainnet.cfg --JsonRpc.Enabled true --HealthChecks.Enabled true --HealthChecks.UIEnabled true --JsonRpc.JwtSecretFile /data/jwtsecret --JsonRpc.Host 192.168.20.41
```

1. This one will prompt for your password in order to become root, unfortunately.
1. You may instead use `--log DEBUG` if you run into trouble. Default is `INFO`.
1. You can wait for this to sync before you continue, but you don't need to. The beacon node will retry if the execution client isn't sync'ed yet.
1. Once up and running, check health with:
    1. `curl http://192.168.20.41:8545/health`
    1. Or if you have a GUI and browser: http://192.168.20.41:8545/healthchecks-ui
1. Port `8551` is also open for JSON RPC.

### MEV Boost

```
/data/mev-boost -mainnet -relay-check -relays https://0xa1559ace749633b997cb3fdacffb890aeebdb0f5a3b6aaa7eeeaf1a38af0a8fe88b9e4b1f61f236d2e64d95733327a62@relay.ultrasound.money
```

### Beacon Node

```
lighthouse --network mainnet --datadir /data/lighthouse/mainnet bn --execution-endpoint http://localhost:8551 --execution-jwt /data/jwtsecret --http --http-address 192.168.20.41 --http-allow-origin "*" --builder http://localhost:18550 --graffiti eliotstock --suggested-fee-recipient <ADDRESS>
```

1. Note that `localhost` is correct here, even though the EL client used `192.168.20.41`.
1. Omit `--debug-level warn` initially to see that all is well.
1. Omit `--http-address` and `--http-allow-origin` if you don't need access to the Beacon Node API on your local network.
1. You can now use the Beacon Node API on http://localhost:5052 but only on the local machine. Do not NAT this through to the internet oy you'll get DDoS'ed.
1. Once you know your validator node index, you can get the current balance of your validator with `curl http://localhost:5052/eth/v1/beacon/states/head/validators/{index}`.

### Validator client

```
lighthouse --network mainnet --datadir /data/lighthouse/mainnet vc --beacon-nodes http://192.168.20.41:5052 --builder-proposals --graffiti eliotstock --suggested-fee-recipient <ADDRESS>
```

1. Omit ` --beacon-nodes http://192.168.20.41:5052` if you don't need access to the Beacon Node API on your local network.

### Check ports

```
sudo lsof -nP -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN +c0 | grep IPv4
```

Check the ports you're listening on. Ignoring the OS services such as `sshd`, you should have:

1. `192.168.20.41:8545 (LISTEN)`: EL client, JSON RPC for general use
1. `127.0.0.1:8551 (LISTEN)`: EL client, JSON RPC for the CL client only
1. `*:9000 (LISTEN)`: CL client, for the EL client
1. `127.0.0.1:5052 (LISTEN)`: CL client, Beacon Node API for general use
1. `127.0.0.1:18550 (LISTEN)`: MEV Boost

## Monitoring

1. Create a user on https://beaconcha.in/.
1. Got to https://beaconcha.in/user/notifications and add your validator.
1. Get the mobile app.
1. Sign in on the mobile app.
1. Consider turning off the missed attestation notification after a week or so of smooth running. They're quite noisy and if you get too many notifications, you risk missing a more important one such as being offline.

## Troubleshooting issues

1. Check disks have space: `df -h`
1. Check CPU load average: `htop`. Should be 0.70 max, times the number of cores. So on an 8-core machine, a load average of 5.6 is the threshold at which the machine is getting overloaded.
1. Check RAM available: `htop`, see `Mem`.
1. Check internet connectivity and speed:
    1. `sudo apt  install speedtest-cli`
    1. `speedtest --secure`
    1. My results: ~250 Mbit/s down, ~90 Mbit/s up.
    1. Minumum according to some Googling: 10 Mbit/s either way.
    1. If your router is a bit rubbish, like mine, you might want to preemptively reboot it once a month ratehr than have it go down in the middle of the night.
1. Check logs:
    1. Execution client: No log levels in logs. Just `grep rror /data/nethermind/logs/mainnet.logs.txt`
    1. Beacon Node: `grep -e WARN -e ERRO -e CRIT /data/lighthouse/mainnet/beacon/logs/beacon.log`
    1. Validator: `grep -e WARN -e ERRO -e CRIT /data/lighthouse/mainnet/validators/logs/validator.log`
    1. Google any errors.
    1. Upgrade to latest stable versions if necessary.
    1. Ask in the Discord server for the client about any errors if they persist after upgrade.

## Updates

1. Subscribe to the repos to get an email on a new release. For each of these, drop down 'Watch', go to 'Custom' and check 'Releases'.
    1. https://github.com/nethermindeth/nethermind/releases
    1. https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/releases
    1. https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/releases
1. If using a PPA, the update to the binary will happen automatically on new releases, but there's no automated restart of the process after that AFACT. It might also take some time to install. If you're in a rush to upgrade:
    1. `sudo apt update`
    1. `apt list --upgradable` and expect to see `nerthermind` in there
    1. `sudo apt upgrade`
1. If you followed the above instructions, here's what you're using:
    1. `nethermind`: PPA
    1. `lighthouse`: binary
    1. `mev-boost`: binary
1. To check which version you're currently running, run these. But be aware that in the case of a PPA, the running process may in fact still be the older version. You'll need to restart to get the new version to start executing.
    1. `nethermind --version` 1.15.0
    1. `lighthouse --version` 3.3.0
    1. `/data/mev-boost --version` 1.5.0
1. On each new release:
    1. Follow the instructions above again to get a new binary.
    1. Overwrite the existing binary.
    1. Wait till the end of an epoch.
    1. Stop only the updated processes.
    1. Restart the process.

## Unstaking

To stop staking, which is different to withdrawal:

* `lighthouse account validator exit`

## What do do if...

### You travel

* Open up your chosen SSH port on your NATs before you go.
* Make sure the laptop you take has the SSH keys for the staking machine - test connecting from outside, using a mobile internet connection.
* Disable the SSH port NAT when you get back.

### Your staking machine gets stolen

* Don't panic about losing your stake. The withdrawal private key is not on the machine and can be generated from the mnemonic only. We haven't even generated that private key yet, anywhere.
* Don't go and build a new staking machine, regenerate the same keys and start running again. You'll risk slashing by double signing if:
    * You didn't turn on Lighthouse's [doppelganger protection](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/validator-doppelganger.html) AND
    * The thief powers on the machine AND
    * The machine manages to find the router on the thief's network because the subnet is the same or the thief cared enough to detect the expected subnet AND
    * The processes are all set up to start on boot using `systemd` OR
    * The thief got the user password and started all the services
* So is it worth turning on doppelganger protection?
    * Probably not. If the machine password is secure and you didn't set up `systemd` services, the chances of the machine ever validating again are low and the cost of DP is two or three epochs of rewards on an upgrade or restart.
* Instead, wait a month or two and monitor your validator index.
    * If it never starts running again, it's low enough risk to build a new machine and start validating again with regenerated keys.
    * There's little point in the thief extracting the validator key from the machine, because it can't be used without the password anyway.

### You move house

* See "Unstaking" above.

### You need the Beacon Node API on your local network

* `sudo ufw allow 5052/tcp comment 'beacon node api'`
* `sudo ufw reload`
* Get the local IP of your host with `ip a` (eg. `http://192.168.20.41:5052/`)
* You won't be able to use the Swagger UI version hosted by the Ethereum Foundation repo at https://ethereum.github.io/beacon-APIs, because it uses `https`. When the browser makes requests to your beacon node, they'll be over straight `http` and you'll get a `Mixed content` error on the browser console. You could serve the API over `https` but it's easier not to.
* Instead just run Swagger UI locally.
    * `git clone git@github.com:ethereum/beacon-APIs.git`
    * `cd beacon-APIs`
    * `python3 -m http.server 8080`
    * Open http://localhost:8080 and set the version to `dev` (release number version will fail because we haven't built the `releases` directory).
    * Set the `server_url` to `http://192.168.20.41:5052/`
    * Test some API endpoints.

## Sedge

If this seems like a ton of work, you can forget most of the above and just install and run `sedge`: https://docs.sedge.nethermind.io/docs/quickstart/install-guide

1. Expect `segde` to use about 1TB per month in bandwidth. It'll be more while sync'ing, then decrease.
1. To start the `sedge` containers once installed: `sudo docker compose -f docker-compose-scripts/docker-compose.yml up -d execution consensus`
1. To stop them: `sudo docker compose -f docker-compose-scripts/docker-compose.yml down`
1. Running as root was necessary on my host, but can be avoided (Google it).
